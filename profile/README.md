# NÃ¸rd ðŸš€

NÃ¸rd is a modern JavaScript framework that enables developers to build web applications with fine-grained reactivity and a component-based architecture. It uses [tagged templates](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#tagged_templates) for HTML rendering and Grains as primary reactive primitive. NÃ¸rd is [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)-centric, offering fully typed components and templates.

## Key Features

-   **Component-Based Architecture**: Build your UI with reusable and composable components, enhancing maintainability and reusability.
-   **Fine-Grained Reactivity**: Efficiently update your UI with fine-grained reactivity using Grains, a unique feature that connects values directly to DOM nodes.
-   **No JSX Required**: Utilize tagged template literals for a cleaner and more intuitive syntax, removing the need for compiling JSX.
-   **TypeScript Support**: Take advantage of full TypeScript support for a strongly typed development experience, enhancing code quality and maintainability.
-   **Directives**: Enhance your templates with powerful directives for DOM manipulation, offering declarative access to the DOM.
-   **Dependency-Free**: Enjoy the benefits of a framework that operates without external dependencies, making your project lightweight and faster to load.
